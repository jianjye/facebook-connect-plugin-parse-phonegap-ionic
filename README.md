# How to Set Up Apache Cordova Facebook Plugin and Parse in Ionic Framework V2

These are the sample codes demonstrating how to implement Facebook Login in an Ionic Framework App with the official Apache Phonegap Facebook Connect Plugin, AngularJS UI Router, and Parse as the backend.

To make this work, you will need to replace the followings to your own values:
* FACEBOOK_APP_ID
  * Dummy value "12345678901234567890" was used in some cases
* PARSE_APP_ID
* PARSE_JAVASCRIPT_KEY

Full explanation is available here: http://jianjye.com/how-to-set-up-apache-cordova-facebook-plugin-and-parse-in-ionic-framework-v2/

**I highly recommend following the article step-by-step and build your app from scratch instead.**


## Older version

V1 has been completely overwritten as it was based on Cordova 2.x and will not work without adjustments on the latest versions. It is available at commit [26e1d797a5c86d435e04e9554a079f5134795505](https://github.com/jjsee/facebook-connect-plugin-parse-phonegap-ionic/commit/26e1d797a5c86d435e04e9554a079f5134795505) if you want to refer back.
