# How to Set Up Apache Cordova Facebook Plugin and Parse in Ionic Framework V2

This is the sample codes demonstrating how to implement Facebook Login in an Ionic app with the official Apache Phonegap Facebook Connect Plugin, AngularJS UI Router, and Parse as the backend.

To make this work, you will need to replace the followings to your own values:
* FACEBOOK_APP_ID
  * The dummy FACEBOOK_APP_ID "12345678901234567890" used
* PARSE_APP_ID
* PARSE_JAVASCRIPT_KEY

Full explanation is available here: http://jianjye.com/how-to-set-up-apache-cordova-facebook-plugin-and-parse-in-ionic-framework-v2/

**I highly recommend following the article step-by-step and build your app from scratch instead.**
